#+title: Miniverse: Thingiverse Downloads Manager
#+startup: showeverything

* Introduction

With the exciting addition of a 3d printer to my life I was finding
myself downloading a bunch of files from thingiverse to browse and
maybe print later.

Soon I was up to me knees in a small pile of zipfiles that I wanted to
extract, in a consistently named way, that also lets me get back to
the original thingiverse page.  That's all in the
~zip/LICENSE.txt~ so it's just a case of extracting it,
scraping it, and doing as it says.

* Usage

** miniverse store THINGS

Take a Thing, which may be a zipfile or extracted directory, and
stores it in the miniverse directory according to the naming scheme.

** miniverse home THINGS

Opens up the thingiverse homepage for the given things in your
browser.  Will defaults to =['.']= (thing in the current working directory)
